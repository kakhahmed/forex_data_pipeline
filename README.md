# The Forex Data Pipeline

This is a data pipeline built using airflow as an practical exercise to deepen my hands-on experience with Airflow along with other data tools.

This data pipeline is build while attending the [Apache Airflow: The Hands-On Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-hands-on-course-to-master-apache-airflow/?couponCode=GENAISALE24) online course on Udemy by [Marc Lamberti](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-hands-on-course-to-master-apache-airflow/#instructor-1)
